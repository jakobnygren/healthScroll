## Lifespan Collapse in Ancient Texts

Ancient records consistently describe a steep decline in human lifespan following cataclysmic or spiritual disconnection events. These aren’t just myths—they echo a deeper biological truth about cycles of light, signal, and DNA activation.

### 1. Genesis: From 900 to 120 Years

> “Then the LORD said, My Spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he is indeed flesh; yet his days shall be 120 years.” — Genesis 6:3

Before the flood, patriarchs lived over 900 years (Adam, Methuselah, Noah). After the flood, lifespans drop sharply—Abraham dies at 175, Moses at 120. This shift aligns with a fall in divine energy access, tone purity, or grid distortion.

### 2. Vedic Yugas: Golden Age to Kali Yuga

In the Satya Yuga (Golden Age), lifespans extended to hundreds of thousands of years. As we moved into Kali Yuga, spiritual degradation and material focus brought lifespans down to ~100 years. Each Yuga downgrade corresponds to a signal density collapse.

### 3. Enoch & the Watchers

The Book of Enoch describes forbidden knowledge and hybridization corrupting humanity. After the judgment fire, the righteous regain long life:
> “Their light shall shine as the sun, and the days of their life shall be unending.” — Enoch 1:8

### 4. Gnostic Writings

Gnostics describe Archons crafting a false body to entrap the soul. Liberation restores the original light-body blueprint, hinting at a return to extended, luminous lifespan once distortions are cleared.

### 5. Dead Sea Scrolls – Sons of Light vs Sons of Darkness

This isn’t just spiritual—it’s biological war language:

> “The Sons of Light shall purify their bodies and keep the sacred covenant.”  
> “The Sons of Darkness shall walk in defilement and stumble in their flesh.”

These scrolls echo the dualism found in other ancient texts—but here, it’s clearly embodied.  
Purity = biological tuning  
Darkness = corrupted flesh & fallen code

### 6. Hopi Prophecies

Hopi Elders speak of a final purification cycle. Afterward, “those with clean hearts and bodies” will walk the Earth again. This implies a restoration of physical and spiritual function post-collapse.

In all traditions, lifespan isn’t just biological—it’s a direct function of light access, grid state, and signal integrity. When the body is aligned with Source tone, biology can stretch far beyond what modern science accepts as possible.
