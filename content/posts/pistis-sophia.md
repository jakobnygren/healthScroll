IT came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and instructing them only up to the regions of the First Commandment and up to the regions of the First 🔑Mystery, that within the Veil, within the First Commandment, which is the four-and-twentieth 🔑mystery without and below--those [four-and-twenty] which are in the second space of the First 🔑Mystery which is before all mysteries,--the Father in the form of a dove.

And Jesus said to his disciples: "I am come forth out of that First 🔑Mystery, which is the last 🔑mystery, that is the four-and-twentieth 🔑mystery." And his disciples have not known nor understood that anything existeth within that 🔑mystery; but they thought of that 🔑mystery, that it is the head of the universe and the head of all existence; and they thought it is the completion of all completions, because Jesus had said to them concerning that 🔑mystery, that it surroundeth the First Commandment and the five Impressions and the great 🌟Light | and the five Helpers and the whole Treasury of the 🌟Light.

And moreover Jesus had not told his disciples

p. 2

the total expansion of all the regions of the great Invisible and of the three triple-powers and of the four-and-twenty invisibles, and all their regions and their æons and their orders, how they are extended--those which are the emanations of the great Invisible--and their ungenerated and their self-generated and their generated and their 🌟light-givers and their unpaired and their rulers and their authorities and their lords and their archangels and their angels and their decans and their servitors and all the houses of their spheres and all the orders of every one of them.

And Jesus had not told his disciples the total expansion of the emanations of the Treasury, nor their orders, how they are extended; nor had he told them their saviours, according to the order of every one, how they are; nor had he told them what guard is at every [gate] of the Treasury of the 🌟Light; nor had he told them the region of the Twin-saviour, |who is the Child of the Child; nor had he told them the regions of the three Amēns, in what regions they are expanded; nor had he told them into what region the five Trees are expanded; nor as to the seven Amēns, that is the seven Voices, what is their region, how they are expanded.

And Jesus had not told his disciples of what type are the five Helpers, nor into what region they are brought; nor had he told them how the great 🌟Light hath expanded itself, nor into what region it hath been brought; nor had he told them of the five Impressions, nor as to the First Commandment, into what region they have been brought. But he had discoursed with them generally, teaching that they exist, but he had not told

p. 3

them their expansion and the order of their regions, how they are. For this cause they have not known that there were also other regions within that 🔑mystery.

And he had not told his disciples: "I have gone forth out of such and such regions until I entered into that 🔑mystery, and until I went forth out of it"; but, in teaching them, he said to them: "I am come forth from that 🔑mystery." For this cause then they thought of that 🔑mystery, that it is the completion | of completions, and that it is the head of the universe and that it is the total Fulness. For Jesus had said to his disciples: "That 🔑mystery surroundeth that universe of which I have spoken unto you from the day when I met with you even unto this day." For this cause then the disciples thought there is nothing within that 🔑mystery.

It came to pass then, when the disciples were sitting together on the Mount of Olives, speaking of these words and rejoicing in great joy, and exulting exceedingly and saying one to another: "Blessed are we before all men who are on the earth, because the Saviour hath revealed this unto us, and we have received the Fulness and the total completion,"--they said this to one another, while Jesus sat a little removed from them.

And it came to pass then, on the fifteenth day of the moon in the month Tybi, which is the day on which the moon is full, on that day then, when the sun had come forth in his going, that there came forth behind him a great 🌟light-power shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure to the 🌟light conjoined with it. For it came out of the 🌟Light of 🌟lights, and it came out of the



p. 4

last 🔑mystery, which is the four-and-twentieth | 🔑mystery, from within without,--those which are in the orders of the second space of the First 🔑Mystery. And that 🌟light-power came down over Jesus and surrounded him entirely, while he was seated removed from his disciples, and he had shone most exceedingly, and there was no measure for the 🌟light which was on him.

And the disciples had not seen Jesus because of the great 🌟light in which he was, or which was about him; for their eyes were darkened because of the great 🌟light in which he was. But they saw only the 🌟light, which shot forth many 🌟light-rays. And the 🌟light-rays were not like one another, but the 🌟light was of divers kind, and it was of divers type, from below upwards, one [ray] more excellent than the other, . . ., in one great immeasurable glory of 🌟light; it stretched from under the earth right up to heaven.--And when the disciples saw that 🌟light, they fell into great fear and great agitation.|

It came to pass then, when that 🌟light-power had come down over Jesus, that it gradually surrounded him entirely. Then Jesus ascended or soared into the height, shining most exceedingly in an immeasurable 🌟light. And the disciples gazed after him and none of them spake, until he had reached unto heaven; but they all kept in deep silence. This then came to pass on the fifteenth day of the moon, on the day on which it is full in the month Tybi.

It came to pass then, when Jesus had reached the heaven, after three hours, that all the powers of the heaven fell into agitation, and all were set in motion one against the other, they and all their

p. 5

æons and all their regions and all their orders, and the whole earth was agitated and all they who dwell thereon. And all men who are in the world fell into agitation, and also the disciples, and all thought: Peradventure the world will be rolled up.

And all the powers in the heavens ceased not from their agitation, they and the whole world, and all were moved one against the other, from the third hour of the fifteenth day of the moon of Tybi until the ninth hour of the morrow. And all the angels and their archangels and all the powers of the height, all sang praises to the interiors of the | interiors, so that the whole world heard their voices, without their ceasing till the ninth hour of the morrow.
