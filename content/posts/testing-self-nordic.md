### Introduction

This terrain assessment reflects a comprehensive hormone profile captured via Nordic Lab's saliva and bloodspot testing. The individual had recently begun the **Hakala iodine protocol** alongside **high-dose boron**, a combination known to influence thyroid output, steroid hormone conversion, and detoxification dynamics. This analysis goes beyond pathology to explore **hormonal orchestration**, **bioelectrical tone**, and **terrain resilience**.

### 1. Circadian Foundation – Cortisol Rhythm

| Timepoint | Value (ng/mL) | Reference Range | Interpretation |
|----------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Morning  | 4.6            | 3.7–9.5          | ✅ Mid-range — healthy awakening |
| Noon     | 2.5            | 1.2–3.0          | ✅ Functional alertness |
| Evening  | 1.1            | 0.6–1.9          | ✅ Appropriate tapering |
| Night    | 0.5            | 0.4–1.0          | ✅ Melatonin onset support |

This clean downward slope from morning to night reflects a **well-synchronized HPA axis**, promoting calm sleep initiation, digestive fire in the morning, and stable daytime energy.

### 2. Androgen Status – Testosterone & DHEAS

| Marker       | Value       | Reference Range            | Interpretation |
|--------------|-------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| Testosterone | 825 ng/dL   | ~300–1000 ng/dL             | ✅ High-normal — peak anabolic tone |
| DHEAS        | 224 µg/dL   | ~80–560 µg/dL               | ✅ Mid-range — stable adrenal reserve |

This pattern reveals **high testosterone activity** and a supportive DHEA backbone. The elevated testosterone may result from **boron-induced SHBG suppression**, compounded by improved thyroid stimulation via iodine.

---

### 3. Estrogenic Tone – Estradiol, Estrone & Progesterone

| Marker        | Value        | Reference Range         | Interpretation |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| Estradiol (E2)| 32 pg/mL     | 14–32 pg/mL              | ✅ High-normal — potent signal |
| Estrone (E1)  | <15 pg/mL    | <15–48 pg/mL             | ⚠️ Suppressed — low recycling |
| Progesterone  | 0.3 ng/mL    | <0.1–0.9 ng/mL           | ✅ Mid-range — grounding buffer |

A **high-output estradiol signal** is buffered by adequate progesterone, yet the lack of estrone suggests **little estrogenic recycling or storage**. This pattern may arise from low aromatase activity (lean mass, boron, polyphenols) or high detox throughput.

### 4. Binding, Inflammation & Thyroid Signaling

| Marker         | Value        | Reference Range            | Interpretation |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------|
| SHBG           | 24 nmol/L    | 18–44 nmol/L                | ✅ Functional hormone transport |
| PSA            | 2.7 ng/mL    | <4.0 ng/mL (2.5–4 borderline) | ⚠️ Slightly elevated — monitor inflammation/zinc |
| T/SHBG Ratio   | 1.2          | 0.5–2.1                     | ✅ Free androgen balance |

| Thyroid Marker | Value        | Reference Range     | Interpretation |
|----------------|--------------|----------------------|----------------|
| TSH            | 3.2 µU/mL     | 0.5–3.0 µU/mL         | ⚠️ Slightly elevated — transitional response |
| Free T3        | 4.3 pg/mL     | 1.9–4.4 pg/mL         | ✅ High-normal — optimal activation |
| Free T4        | 1.2 ng/dL     | 0.8–1.6 ng/dL         | ✅ Mid-range — stable reserve |
| TPOab          | 16 IU/mL      | 0–150 IU/mL           | ✅ No autoimmune thyroid process |

**TSH elevation is expected** during iodine reactivation, especially early in the Hakala protocol. The thyroid remains functionally strong, with no sign of autoimmunity.

### Terrain Reflections

This terrain shows **robust anabolic signals**, clean cortisol rhythm, strong thyroid throughput, and only minor imbalances in estrogen storage and PSA inflammation markers.

#### Patterns to Watch

- **Estrone suppression**: may reflect lean aromatase activity or overactive methylation.
- **PSA elevation**: could suggest low zinc or subtle inflammatory load.
- **TSH spike**: likely a transient iodine effect — not pathological.

#### Optimization Suggestions

- Maintain light hygiene, magnesium intake, and bile support for cortisol rhythm.
- Cycle **zinc 15–25 mg/day** for 2–3 weeks to test PSA response.
- Consider cruciferous vegetables, choline, and methyl B-vitamins for estrogen detox support.
- Recheck thyroid and PSA in 3–6 months after iodine phase stabilizes.

### Closing Note

This profile reflects a **resilient, recalibrating terrain** entering a new metabolic phase. The iodine/boron axis is activating deep endocrine circuits, and the system appears to be responding with strength, agility, and only minor transitional turbulence.

### Optional Add-On Markers – Consider for a Broader Terrain View

If repeating this panel or recommending it to others, the following markers are highly relevant for mapping endocrine terrain and long-term vitality:

#### 🔹 Core Androgens
- **Total Testosterone** – foundation of anabolic tone
- **Free Testosterone (calculated via T/SHBG ratio)** – functional signal strength
- **DHEAS (Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate)** – adrenal reserve and anti-aging marker
- **SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin)** – transport protein affecting availability

#### 🔹 Estrogen Balance
- **Estradiol (E2)** – most bioactive estrogen
- **Estrone (E1)** – estrogenic buffer and detox marker
- **Progesterone** – estrogen modulator, neuroprotective

#### 🔹 Thyroid Axis
- **TSH** – master gland signal (may rise during iodine use)
- **Free T3 and Free T4** – active and reserve thyroid hormone
- **TPO antibodies** – rule out autoimmunity

#### 🔹 Inflammation & Prostate
- **PSA** – tracks prostate burden and inflammation
- **Zinc (serum or RBC)** – important for prostate, immunity, and hormone balance
- **CRP / hs-CRP** – optional, for general inflammation status

### Notes for Friends Considering Testing

- If testosterone is the main focus, also include **SHBG and DHEAS** for meaningful interpretation.
- To understand how hormones move and convert, **estradiol, estrone, and progesterone** provide crucial insight.
- Thyroid markers add depth and show **how well the body is metabolizing hormones**, especially after iodine/boron use.

For best results:
- Avoid heavy training, alcohol, or zinc supplementation for 48 hours before testing.
- If using iodine or boron, note how many weeks in — these can **shift hormonal signaling** and affect interpretation.
