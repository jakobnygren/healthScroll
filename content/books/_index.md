These four symbolic books form a unified map of collapse, terrain, tone, and awakening — moving from the inner kingdom, to its infrastructures, to its pressure patterns, and finally to its expression at collective scale.

## 🗝️ Companion Text — The Symbolic Key
*A reader’s orientation guide*

A short companion text explaining how to read the Collapse Geometry books without mistaking metaphor for mechanism.
It clarifies how symbolism is used, what the books deliberately avoid, and how multiple interpretations can coexist safely.

This text is optional, but recommended for readers who want orientation without losing the symbolic experience.

## 🐍 Book I — The Hydra: The Geometry of Collapse
A symbolic map of how terrain falls apart and how coherence returns.  
Not psychology, not biology, not metaphysics — but a language that can hold all three.  
A guide for anyone who has walked through fear, identity fracture, and internal collapse,  
and senses that something deeper is trying to reassemble.

## ⚗️ Book II — Metals of Collapse: The Six Entropic Archetypes
A symbolic exploration of how metals form the infrastructure of collapse,  
how villain archetypes shape terrain patterns,  
and how tone transmutes even the darkest architecture back into coherence.

## 🔺 Book III — Cancer: The Panic Geometry
A symbolic map of how collapse concentrates into tight, self-reinforcing loops;  
why pressure organizes into proliferative patterns;  
and how tone reframes what fear interprets as inevitable.

## 🌐 Book IV — The Societal Hydra: Collapse at Scale
A symbolic lens on how civilizations drift into survival bandwidth,  
how fear propagates through narrative corridors,  
and how collective tone returns after periods of mass fragmentation.
