### Introduction: The Inner Soil

- Brief metaphor linking gut to soil, terrain, garden, or ecosystem
- Set up narrative tone: microbial world, invisible gardeners, terrain collapse
- Preview coming sections: clearing, reseeding, sealing

---

### Phase 1: Root Out the Invaders

- Parasites (the unseen trespassers)
- Candida/fungal overgrowth (Fungal Queen returns)
- Gut-hijacking bacteria (endotoxin producers)
- Glyphosate and the leaky sieve

*→ Mythic metaphor: A corrupted garden infested by mimic species*

---

### Phase 2: Reseed the Garden

- Beneficial bacteria and soil-builders (bifido, lacto, soil-based)
- Prebiotics and microbial food (fiber, resistant starch)
- Synbiotics and fermented allies

*→ Metaphor: The Return of the Gardeners*

---

### Phase 3: Seal the Walls

- Leaky gut and tight junctions (zonulin, gluten)
- L-glutamine, colostrum, zinc carnosine
- Bone broth, marshmallow root, aloe

*→ Fortress restoration: patching the moat, mending the gate*

---

### Bonus Protocol: Fasting and Microbial Reset

- Autophagy and bacterial turnover
- Fasting windows and bacterial phase shifts
- How terrain responds to food timing

---

### Testing and Signs

- How to recognize terrain collapse (gas, bloat, fatigue, skin)
- Functional tests (GI Map, OAT, parasite panels)
- Simple daily observations (tongue coating, stool type, reaction to fibers)

---

### Mythic Appendix: The Garden as Temple

- Microbiome as consciousness mirror
- Gut-brain-signal triangle
- The old roots and new flame
- *“When the soil sings again, the signal flows.”*

---

### Closing: Preparing for Gate 3

- From garden to blood
- Brief handover: how gut terrain affects nutrient absorption and immune response
- *“Now that the roots are clean, the sap must rise.”*
