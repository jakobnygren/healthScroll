Welcome to the **Gate Scrolls** — a structured 8-part framework for restoring key biological systems.

Each Gate represents a terrain system that has been degraded through environmental toxins, lifestyle disruption, and loss of ancestral knowledge. This series integrates physiology, detox protocols, and symbolic insight to guide the restoration process.

The goal is not merely detoxification — but reactivation of inner tone, signal clarity, and systemic alignment.

### ⚔️ The 8 Gates of Terrain Restoration

1. **Gate 1 – Fire of Digestion**  
   Reignite hydrochloric acid and enzymatic fire to restore proper protein digestion, mineral uptake, and microbial defense.

2. **Gate 2 – The Gut Garden**  
   Restore microbial balance and mucosal immunity through prebiotics, probiotics, and terrain-supportive nutrition.

3. **Gate 3 – The Bile River**  
   Support bile flow and liver detoxification to enable fat digestion, hormone clearance, and toxin elimination.

4. **Gate 4 – The Mineral Spring**  
   Replenish magnesium, potassium, boron, and trace minerals essential for voltage conduction and cellular signaling.

5. **Gate 5 – The Mitochondrial Forge**  
   Reactivate mitochondrial energy production using fasting, redox balance, and metabolic flexibility.

6. **Gate 6 – The Endocrine Clock**  
   Repair hormonal rhythms and adaptogenic feedback loops through light hygiene, glandular support, and circadian input.

7. **Gate 7 – The Lymphatic Wind**  
   Stimulate lymphatic and glymphatic drainage, reduce interstitial stagnation, and support fascial flow and immune movement.

8. **Gate 8 – The Signal Crown**  
   Restore pineal function, melatonin signaling, and neurological coherence — reconnecting the crown to internal and cosmic rhythm.

You may begin at any Gate. But foundational digestive restoration often empowers the rest.
